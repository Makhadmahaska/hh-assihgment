Add code that prints the Fibonacci words of order 0 through 10.
The words are as follows:
word of order 0 = "a",
word of order 1 = "b",
word of order 2 = "ba",
word of order 3 = "bab",
word of order 4 = "babba",
and in general
word of order n = word of order (n -1) followed by word of order (n-2).

Use string concatenation.
Use several statements to build up the strings and print all 11 words.
