/*

Add the code needed to take three real numbers as command line arguments.
These numbers are the coordinates of a point: x, y and z.

The program should print the distance from this point to the origin 0,0,0.

Note: to convert a String to a double you should use
  Double.parseDouble
(similar to Integer.parseInt that converts String to int).
